# Welcome to My Portfolio Page!

I am a developer with 3 years of experience. 2+ years of
this was game development. I am a person who likes to
learn and develop by myself. Since high school, I have
had many small-scale enterprises and studies with my
interest in technology. During my years at college, I
decided what I wanted to do and developed myself as a
developer. I am currently making hypercasual&casual,
Unity Asset and ASP.NET projects for my portfolio and publishing
them on YouTube&GitHub. I love learning new things by myself 
and trying my skills on a project. 

Since elementary school, I was known as the "tech guy" in the school.
I had a great passion for computers and technology. With this, I 
started working as an editor in high school and became both video editor
and news editor. In late high school, I realized that I also have a
passion for software development and started learning it. After this
period, I had a couple of chances to work and develop my skills in 
the professional field.
