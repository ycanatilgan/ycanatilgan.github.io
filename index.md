# Welcome to My Portfolio Page!

I am a developer with 3 years of experience. 2+ years of
this was game development. I am a person who likes to
learn and develop by myself. Since high school, I have
had many small-scale enterprises and studies with my
interest in technology. During my years at college, I
decided what I wanted to do and developed myself as a
developer. I am currently making hypercasual&casual
and Unity Asset projects for my portfolio and publishing
them on YouTube&GitHub.
